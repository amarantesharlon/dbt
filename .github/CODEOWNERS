# This file contains the code owners for the dbt-core repo.
# PRs will be automatically assigned for review to the associated
# team(s) or person(s) that touches any files that are mapped to them.
#
# A statement takes precedence over the statements above it so more general
# assignments are found at the top with specific assignments being lower in
# the ordering (i.e. catch all assignment should be the first item)
#
# Consult GitHub documentation for formatting guidelines:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners#example-of-a-codeowners-file

# As a default for areas with no assignment,
# the core team as a whole will be assigned
*       @dbt-labs/core-team
