# This Action checks makes a dbt run to sample json structured logs
# and checks that they conform to the currently documented schema.
# 
# If this action fails it either means we have unintentionally deviated
# from our documented structured logging schema, or we need to bump the
# version of our structured logging and add new documentation to
# communicate these changes.
