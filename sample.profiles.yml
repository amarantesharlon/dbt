      schema: my_model_schema # the schema to create models in. commonly "dbt_" + a suffix for development, and "analytics" for production
  run-target: my-target       # default target; can be overridden at run time.

# create a second profile. You can switch to this profile in the CLI with --profile my-profile
# Valid dbt options include:
# dbt debug --profile my-profile # use my-profile profile with default "dev" run target
# dbt debug --profile my-profile --target dev # explicitly use "dev" run target
# dbt debug --profile my-profile --target prod # switch to the "prod" run target
# these flags work with `dbt (debug|compile|run|test)` as you would expect!
