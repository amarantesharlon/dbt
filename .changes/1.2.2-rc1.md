## dbt-core 1.2.2-rc1 - October 03, 2022
### Features
- This conditionally no-ops warehouse connection at compile depending on an env var, disabling introspection/queries during compilation only. This is a temporary solution to more complex permissions requirements for the semantic layer. ([#5936](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/5936), [#5926](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/pull/5926))
### Fixes
- Fix race condition when invoking dbt via lib.py concurrently ([#5919](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/issues/5919), [#5921](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core/pull/5921))
